        <h3>About</h3>
           <p>MedTracker is an application that is designed to streamline the process of remembering to take your medication. Once you 
           have registered with us, the only work you have to do is to input your medication details and we do the rest for you.
           <br/><br/>
           You will receive a simple alert to remind you when it is time to take your medicine, when you are running low on your 
           medicine, and on top of that, allow you to order a repeat prescription. 
           <br/><br/>
           Take away the stress, and sign up for a free account now.</p>
